# python-challenge-Module 3 Challenge
PyBank Goal:To analyze a financial dataset for a company called budget_data.csv.

In this challenge, I create a Python script that analyzes financial records. The script calculates the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes, and finally, the greatest increase and decrease in profits with their respective dates. The results are printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.

A complete list of candidates who received votes.
The percentage of votes each candidate won.
The total number of votes each candidate won.
The winner of the election based on popular vote.
